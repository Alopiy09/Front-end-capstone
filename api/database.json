Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?  Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.  My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Never let anyone know what you are thinking.",
