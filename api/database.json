      "story": "Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen.  I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. You can act like a man! Friends and money - oil and water.  That's my family Kay, that's not me. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?  In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. When they come... they come at what you love. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? What's wrong with being a lawyer?  This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.",
