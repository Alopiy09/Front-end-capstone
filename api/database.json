      "story": "Thunder cracks over head illuminating the road in front of you. You see the deep ruts where wagons have crossed for trade begin to fill with muddy water from the rain. Coming face on is a carriage drawn by two massive horses. A lantern is suspended over the carriage giving some light on the driver, which from this distance looks to be a pile of furs drenched to the bone. As you draw near the driver speaks up.\n\n\"grun'n\":Hello there traveler need any wares?\n\nAs you get close you feel a strange presence emanating from him. Its not evil but simply uncertain. \n\n(if conversation is initiated he will speak about his wares and how he is a travelling merchant. After a bit of conversation and possibly some purchases he will offer to accompany you to your destination. DC 15 to spot a necklace he wears called the pendant of fate. if the player notices and comments on the necklace Grun'n will pull it out smile softly and say)\n\n\"grun'n\": ay this old thing came to me in a vision it is what leads me and something in it is telling me to follow you.\n\nThe newly formed group moves off in a singular direction. two more hours pass before the long road finally catches up to you and you feel the call for rest. \n\nDuring your sleep a dream comes to you.The same dream you have had your entire life. It shows a wide and barren plane with weapons strewn everywhere dead bodies litter the field and in the middle of it all sits a black tower. Its material is so dark that the very outline of the tower fades into the night sky. A sudden bright light shines everywhere casting all the shadows away. in the center of the light you can feel a source of immense power.Just as suddenly as it all started it ends. you wake up drenched in sweat shivering.(if the player left without Grun'n he will be by the fire and start speaking instantly begin speaking) Grun'n sits by the fire and looks up while holding the strange rock that is on his necklace. \n\n\"grun'n\" : So you are cursed with dreams. If you dont mind my asking what sort of dreams do you have.\n\nafter the decision is made to tell grun'n he will respond with either\n\n(you told him): *he nods slowly* tis an uncertain omen but it will at least reinforce my certainty of following you.*he nods to himself and seems to fall asleep in his beard*.\n\n(you didnt  tell him):*he grunts* i understand, its no business of mine.*he nods to himself and seems to fall asleep in his beard*.\n\nYou wake up early the rain died during the night but everything is still damp. The embers of the fire slowly sizzle as the last of the heat leaves them. The day is brighter than yesterdays and the sun is just starting to peak through the trees. Grun'n is up and eating an apple.\n\n\"grun'n\": Oh yer up good here have one *he offers an apple* the roads are starting to dry up which will be good for travel *he nods to the road* now do you know where yer going?\n\nYou do its only a fading memory though. You have been seeking an ancient ruin buried thousands of feet under the ground. In the ruins is a citadel ran by duregar who are ruled over by and evil mindflayer.\n\nGrun'n:   *does not break eye contact but you see his knuckels turn white as he grips the apple even tighter early causing it to burst* Ive heard of such ruins but to get to them you will need to be allowed access to the ancient crypts of the dwarven kingdom located inside of FiresBane Mountain. It is a long way to travel but... but i will join you if you let me.\n\n1 days travel to the next town of Leebrun \n\nduring the day the ride is mostly uneventful. 2 encounters\n\nabout 3 hours into travel the group will come across a woman sitting by the road crying into her dress.\n\n\"lady\":Oh heavens please help me they have taken everything and left me with not even my children please help me.\n\nif they pass the lady will curse at them and let them go.\n\nif they stop the lady begins to laugh as 2 bowmen jump out of the bushes aiming bows at them.\n\n\"thief#1\": Now what do we have here.\n\n\"thief#2\": looks like a good samaritan stopped and got themselves into a trap\"\n\n\"lady\": *pulls an unseen dagger* drop the weapons and give us whatever you have.\n\nAfter the fight grun'n will say a prayer and get back on the carriage. \n\n\"Grun'n\": sorry folk cant even get enough to survive they resort to highway robbery. a true shame.\n\nafter a few more hours you come across a beautiful spring with small lights dancing over head.\n\n\"grun'n\": by the gods what is this. i have traveled this road many times and have never seen this. What should we do.\n\n(perception check of 12 will reveal that the lights are will-o-wisps)\n\nif they choose to explore they will find that the water is cool and soothing. At the bottom of the pool is a sword (can be spotted with a 15 perception check).takes 2 athletics checks to swim to 10,12 then a strength check of 15 to pull the sword. Once the sword has been pulled the wanderer will fall unconscious and have another dream. in this dream the wanderer will see all the previous wielders of the sword with a black figure standing in the middle the figures will slowly step away and the wanderer will wake up sputtering couphing up water with Grun'n standing over her yelling her name.\n\n\"grun'n\": Wake up (name) WAKE UP. oh good you are alive what the hell happend there you swam under and then floated back to the top.\n\nAfter wrapping that situation up the group has another six hours of uneventful travel before they reach the town of Leebrun.\n\nOccupants of Leebrun\n\nsmithy- elf - Levandar- Tack n Trade- basic equipment for sale no magic- a tall well built elf with jet black hair in a pony tail. wearing a leather smock over basic clothes.\nif you bring the sword to the elf he will be amazed at the craftsmanship and says that the only time he has seen this sort of smithing was an ancient relics from the time of the magma dwarves.\n\ninnkeeper- human - bill - Restawhile - food supplies rooms\nconstible- human - Sir FoxWood\nMedium height sturdy built gray hair with a thick mustache. hates goblins and is super suspicious of burst/spurt tasks the player with following them around and see what they are up to.

Sir FoxWood will ask the group to take them on and get rid of the pests.\n\npriest - halfling - Father mulgrim - church of Lathander - holy atonement\nvery short very old blind in both eyes completely bald .will offer help with your soul and if you purchase the holy atonement he will speak on your story and tell you what path you are following\n\nlevel up\n\noddities shop - troll/goblin - burst/spurt - TRDE - mostly junk but with a 16 perception check will find an old book that fascinates Grun'n \nafter being asked to follow the pair of misfits after dark.(dc 12 perception) they will see the pair leave the hut after dark and starts heading back into the woods. (dc 16 perception) either you get ambushed or you spot them either way 3 goblin scouts will attack.\n\nOnce the ambush has been dealt with, it will take n extra 30 mins of travel to find the site (dc 15 perception). inside the camp will be 4 more goblins around a fire talking to burst/spurt \n\n\"goblin#1\": WE ASKED FOR THE SHARP STICKS and you bring us DULL WHACKeMs \n\n\"goblin#2\": Maybe they want us to die when we raid\n\n\"gobln#1\": EVIL TRAtORS DIE are youa traitor\n\n\"spurt\": NONONO whys would we betray you, you are of our blood. Come on guys ill bring you the good stuff next time just take it and please dont raid my village anymore i need them to sell my wares.\n\nafter the party decides what to do they either talk to sir FoxWood or attack the camp. Sir FoxWood will ask you to take care of the camp for a reward. if you speak to the duo before Sir FoxWood he will plead with them to report nothing as these goblins arent attacking this town only because he is giving them loot. With enough convincing you can get him to give you a discount for taking out the camp and not turning him in. Sir FoxWood will give you 200 gold for taking care of the camp and an extra 50 gold if you find a link between the goblins and Burst/Spurt.\n\nafter several days in town Grun'n will complain that you arent moving enough and if your dreams mean anything we should probably get going. the town has 2 exits either take the road out of town and head towards The Cauldron a large dip in the plains that keeps heat trapped in but is home to a strangely heat resistant breed of hill dwarves. Or you can leave on a boat for 50(gp) the boat will take you up river to the logging town of FellingGon. \n\n2 days by boat to FellingGon\n4 days walking to The Cauldron\nEND OF SESSION 1\n\nThe Town of FellinGon\n\nlumber master - dwarf - toth MarrowDrinker\na sturdy dwarf with thick calloused hands a short beard and a single long brown braid. the lumber master will be very disgruntled as his operations are being interrupted.
